# Largest Number

This repository contains an algorithm to find the largest number that can be formed by concatenating a given array of integers.

## Algorithm Overview

To find the largest number, the following steps are performed:

1. Define a custom comparison function `compare` that takes two integers and returns true if their concatenation results in a larger number when the first integer is placed before the second integer, otherwise false.

2. Sort the array of integers using the custom comparison function. This ensures that the integers are arranged in a way that forms the largest number when concatenated.

3. Concatenate the sorted integers to form the result string.

4. Check if the first character of the result string is '0':
   - If it is '0', return "0" (since the largest number cannot start with '0').
   - Otherwise, return the result string.

## Implementation Details

The implementation can be done in any programming language that supports custom comparison functions, such as C++, Python, or Java. Here are the key points:

- Define the custom comparison function `compare`.
- Read the array of integers.
- Sort the array of integers using the custom comparison function.
- Concatenate the sorted integers to form the result string.
- Check if the first character of the result string is '0' and return "0" if true; otherwise, return the result string.

## Example

Suppose we have the following array of integers:

```
[3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
```

Using the algorithm described above, the largest number that can be formed by concatenating these integers is "9534330".

## Conclusion

This algorithm efficiently finds the largest number that can be formed by concatenating a given array of integers, ensuring that the resulting number is as large as possible.
